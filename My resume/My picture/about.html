<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Azeez, but you can call me Zay. I am 21 years old, born on July 16, 2003. Beyond my professional life, I am a proud weeb with a deep love for anime. Some of my favorite series include Naruto, One Punch Man, Bleach, Hunter x Hunter, and One Piece. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and occasionally football. My favorite color is green, and while I don’t have a particular favorite food, if I had to choose, I’d go for Nigerian jollof rice.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a versatile digital marketer and web developer with a background in software engineering. My
            experience includes front-end development, basic scripting, and database management using Python,
            JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. With a strong analytical mindset, I excel at debugging and enhancing user
            experiences. Additionally, I have a passion for knowledge sharing and have leveraged my technical and
            interpersonal skills as a tutor. While I have a solid foundation, I am continuously learning and recently
            started a full-stack web development course to deepen my expertise in both front-end and back-end
            technologies. I am eager to apply my skills in a real-world setting, contributing both technically and
            strategically to innovative projects.
